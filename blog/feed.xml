&lt;h1 id=&quot;adventures-in-home-repair&quot;&gt;Adventures in Home Repair&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal for today was to fix the front door knob and deadlock, as well as replace the bathroom faucet. Only one handle on the faucet is broken, but I pulled it all apart when Amanda was in China and the whole thing looks like it’s slowly falling apart. So instead of a band-aid fix I figured a new one was in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the plan was to get up early, head over to the DIY-Center and pick it all up in order to have the whole day to spend on pretending I know how to DIY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately (or fortunately, given where my priorities were at the moment), I couldn’t help but slip back into bed after taking the poodles out and giving them a few bites to eat of their morning breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had a late-start. Thankfully, the extra time spent in bed allowed me to check the Amazon order for the Poodle’s dog-food stand, which reminded me that the DIY-Center is right next to PetSmart. That led me to the PetSmart website where I found a much nicer dog-food stand. Everything happens for a reason, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around noon I finally ended up heading to PetSmart, picking up the dog-food stand and some treats, and then to the DIY-Center. I knew the knob/lock on our door was funky, but I had no idea what I was in for. Apparently it’s a Mortise? Some sort of antique knob/lock combo. And just happens to be completely incompatible with modern knobs and locks. So instead of getting the door and faucet fixed, I successfully disassembed and then reassembed the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At which time I was missing Amanda, so I went to go spend time with her instead. That’s where I am now. Drinking wine and watching movie trailers with her. Not thinking about what I have to do tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matthew Hardwick</name><email>matthardwick@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Adventures in Home Repair</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why I’m Happy</title><link href="http://mattdhardwick.com/blog/Living-in-2017/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I'm Happy" /><published>2017-11-08T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-11-08T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://mattdhardwick.com/blog/Living-in-2017</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://mattdhardwick.com/blog/Living-in-2017/">&lt;figure class=&quot;third full&quot;&gt;
